## How to Use ?
-As a user, you should enter the website and type something which you wan to search for, as long as you type anything, the engine should give you some suggestions for each time you enter any character, once you finish typing, just hit enter or click on the submit button and you will get the results right away.
***
##How it works ?
- Java Script and Node Js does most of the thing, simple HTML5 and CSS3 properties for a proper view, we used JSON to handle the suggestions file which contains great number of words.

##Project Plan:
-We devided the project into three parts, first, we created a simple sketch to get the project structure clear to understand and work, showing the time required for each task and deviding the tasks over the team, also we made brainstorming session to bring the best method to start working on the project and to bring some ideas. Second, we started to work parallely where everyone of the team took over something to work on, at the end of it, we got the project done and we saved some time  for correcting mistakes and fixing errors and it ends up well.
