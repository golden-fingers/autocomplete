***
## How to Use ?
-As a user, you should enter the website and type something which you wan to search for, as long as you type anything, the engine should give you some suggestions for each time you enter any character, once you finish typing, just hit enter or click on the submit button and you will get the results right away.
***
##How it works ?
-Java Script and Node Js does most of the thing, simple HTML5 and CSS3 properties for a proper view, we used JSON to handle the suggestions file which contains great number of words.
